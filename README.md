## 📈 Data Analysis 

In 1 year Electronic Shop earned 43 000 000$ and hosted 20 000 Customers. From 24 September 2023 to 23 September 2024 the Shop accepted 110 000 orders. Average age of Customer was 49. The youngest customer was 18 years old, and the oldest was 80 years old. From September 2023 to January 2024 the Sales was going up step by step and reached new pick at 6 620 172$. From this time the Chart went little bit down, but was stable until September 2024, but the reason is that there is Data only until 23 September 2024, so it's not full month. The Chart of Quantity and Customers is similiar to Sales.  
The biggest income in this Company was made by Smartphones, that's as much as 21,5 millions in revenue. Three another places are occupied by Smartwatches, Laptops and Tablets. They have similiar prices, about 12,5 millions in revenue. The least income was made by Headphones, only 4 millions in revenue.  
The last Chart with Age ranges is really importart, because it shows that people rarely buy headphones and people aged 30-60 buy much more Smartphones, Smartwatches and Tablets than people aged 70-80, so one of the concept should be an ad targeted towards older people to encourage them. This chart doesn't attach much importance to people aged 10-20, because it includes children who don't usually make decisions about large purchases like purchasing a Smartphone.

Gender:  
The chart with slicers shows that Males make about 2000 more orders and gave 1 000 000$ more income to company than Females. The biggest difference between them is that Males choose more often Smartwatches, Tablets and Headphones than Females.  
Ordered Status:  
People who cancelled the order could have enriched the company by 21 million, so the whole Company Sales could be about 64 000 000$. There was almost 2 times less Customers who cancelled the order and above 2 times less cancelled Quantities. The biggest difference between Completed Order and Cancelled Order was with the Tablet.
